# 📧 Email Alert System: How It Works

## 🌟 Overview

The ESG Email Alert System automatically monitors ESG data and sends personalized email notifications to users when important changes occur. Here's exactly how it works from start to finish.

## 🚀 Complete User Journey

### Step 1: User Signup Process

**What the user sees:**
1. Opens the ESG Dashboard (`streamlit run ultimate_dashboard.py`)
2. Clicks "📧 Email Alerts" in the sidebar navigation
3. Goes to the "🔔 Sign Up" tab
4. Fills out the signup form:
   - **Email Address**: `user@example.com`
   - **Alert Types**: ESG Score Changes, Carbon Alerts, Weekly Summaries, etc.
   - **Companies**: Choose specific companies (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) or all companies
   - **Frequency**: Daily, Weekly, or Monthly alerts
   - **Threshold**: Percentage change that triggers alerts (e.g., 5%)
5. Clicks "📧 Subscribe to Alerts"

**What happens behind the scenes:**
```python
# System creates user record
signup_result = alert_manager.signup_user("user@example.com")

# Creates alert subscriptions
alert_manager.add_alert_subscription(
    email="user@example.com",
    alert_type="esg_score_change",
    companies=["AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA"],
    frequency="weekly",
    threshold=0.05  # 5%
)
```

### Step 2: Email Verification

**What the user receives:**
```html
📧 Subject: Verify Your ESG Alert Subscription

🌱 Welcome to ESG Alerts

Thank you for signing up for ESG alerts!
To complete your registration, please verify your email address.

[✅ Verify Email Address]

If you didn't sign up for ESG alerts, you can safely ignore this email.
```

**What happens when user clicks verify:**
- Token is validated
- User account is activated
- User can now receive alerts

### Step 3: System Monitoring (Continuous)

**How the system works:**
```python
# System continuously monitors ESG data
def get_real_esg_scores(company):
    new_scores = fetch_esg_data(company)
    
    # Check for significant changes
    if EMAIL_ALERTS_ENABLED:
        _check_and_trigger_esg_alerts(company, new_scores)
    
    return new_scores

def _check_and_trigger_esg_alerts(company, new_scores):
    # Calculate change percentage
    change_percent = calculate_change(old_score, new_score)
    
    # If change exceeds user thresholds, send alerts
    if abs(change_percent) > user_threshold:
        alert_manager.send_esg_score_alert(company, old_score, new_score, change_percent)
```

**Example monitoring scenario:**
| Company | Previous Score | Current Score | Change % | Alert Triggered |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| AAPL    | 7.8           | 8.0           | +2.6%    | ✅ Yes (if threshold ≤ 2.6%) |
| MSFT    | 8.1           | 8.1           | 0.0%     | ❌ No |
| TSLA    | 9.0           | 9.2           | +2.2%    | ❌ No (if threshold > 2.2%) |
| GOOGL   | 7.9           | 7.7           | -2.5%    | ✅ Yes (if threshold ≤ 2.5%) |

### Step 4: Alert Generation & Sending

**When an alert is triggered:**

1. **Find Subscribers**: System finds all users subscribed to that company/alert type
2. **Check Thresholds**: Verifies the change exceeds each user's threshold
3. **Generate Email**: Creates personalized HTML email using templates
4. **Send Email**: Sends via SMTP (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
5. **Log Activity**: Records the sent alert in the database

**Sample alert email user receives:**
```html
📧 Subject: ESG Alert: AAPL Score Changed by +2.6%

🌱 ESG Alert: AAPL Score Increased

Apple Inc. (AAPL) ESG score has increased

7.8 → 8.0 (+2.6%)

This change may indicate:
• New renewable energy initiatives
• Improved board diversity  
• Enhanced supply chain transparency
