## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints Used**
```python
# Search for company facilities
facility_url = f"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/PCS_FACILITY/FACILITY_NAME/CONTAINING/{company_name}/JSON"

# Get violation data
violations_url = f"https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/PCS_VIOLATION/NPDES_ID/{facility_id}/JSON"
```

### **Smart Fallback System**
- **Primary**: Real EPA data for actual company facilities
- **Fallback**: Realistic sample data if company not found in EPA database
- **Caching**: 1-hour cache to reduce API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures

### **Data Processing**
```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)  # Cache for 1 hour
def get_epa_environmental_data(company_name):
    # Searches EPA Envirofacts database
    # Returns facility info, compliance status, violations
    # Provides realistic fallback data
```
